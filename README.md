The goal of rweekly.highlights is to create the Weekly Highlights Poll Slack Text.

## Installation

You can install `rweekly.highlights` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("rweekly/rweekly.highlights",
                         dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Poll making

The app started by `run_app()` lets you pick up up to 10 links from the current R Weekly draft (scraped from the GitHub repo, not your local clone), to be voted upon by R Weekly editors. The app outputs the text to be pasted in the '#highlights' Slack channel.
